# Privacy Policy (v.3)

## Prologue

We are Michael Brandtner and Sören Reinecke and develop the Baby Map for you. We respect your privacy and commit ourselves voluntarily to data economy. Data economy means to collect as little personal data as possible. To improve our web app, we do not resort to inscrutable technologies such as cookies, profiling and fingerprinting. Instead, we rely on direct, unobtrusive communication with the users of our web app. We expect users to contact us if they have any wishes or problems. Currently, they can do this through GitHub.

## Definitions

- Application
  - For the purposes of this privacy policy, “application” and “applications” mean all different forms of computer code execution. These do include (not exclusively) web apps, websites, apps, software programs and scripts.
- Data
  - Any form of information that can be represented logically and structured in computer language.
- “Server logs” or “Logs”
  - The logs contain the date and time of an incoming connection, which resource was requested, and the anonymous version of the IP address from which the request came. But it also records how long it took the server to respond. This data in itself cannot be traced back to individual users. They only have an analytical purpose. They help us to recognize whether the server is used at all, but also in what intensity.
- Data economy
  - Data economy is the idea of avoiding the accumulation of personal and other data.
- Usage data
  - Data representing the collective usage behaviour of users.
- Individual usage data
  - Data that represent the usage behaviour of a single user.
- Personal data
  - Data that describes you or your behaviour in computer language.
- Server
  - A fixed installation of a mostly very powerful digital device with connection to the Internet. It provides services on the Internet.
- “IP” or “IP address”
  - The address where your device can be reached on the Internet.
- Cache server
  - A cache server provides resources that are often requested by users' browsers. This shortens the loading time of a website in your browser. These resources are provided manually by the developers of the cache servers. These servers could also keep server logs.
- Operating system
  - Software codes that ensure the basic functionality of your working environment on your computer.
- Router
  - A device on your network that acts as a firewall between the connected devices and the Internet.
- “We”, “us”
  - By “we” and “us” we mean the natural persons Michael Brandtner and Sören Reinecke.
- “You”, “user”
  - We really mean you, the user of the Baby Map.

## What kind of data is collected and where does it go?

When using the search, your search entries are sent to Komoot's geo search engine Photon. This search engine is independent from Komoot's other services and no individual usage data should be collected by Komoot. Only server logs are kept.

When you visit the Baby Map, your browser asks for various files from cache servers in order to reduce loading time. These are from two different providers. The first is Google and [their privacy policy can be viewed here](https://policies.google.com/privacy#infocollect).The second is called DigitalOcean and also has its own [Privacy Policy](https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/privacy-policy/). Your browser sends data to their servers, the baby card cannot influence this process.

For displaying the map and other information (such as addresses, opening hours, names of points of interest) Baby Map uses data of the OpenStreetMap community. The data is stored on our own server. However, the map tiles and the addresses of the POIs are stored on the servers of the OpenStreetMap Foundation (St John's Innovation Centre, Cowley Road, Cambridge, CB4 0WS, United Kingdom) (OSMF). How they handle the usage data collected through the use of their services can be found in their [Privacy Statement](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy).

With other interactions with the Baby Map (loading the web app, moving the map, clicking on interactive elements), data is sent to our server [everest.openstreetmap.de](https://everest.openstreetmap.de) or [babykarte.openstreetmap.de](https://babykarte.openstreetmap.de). These data are necessary for the operation of the Baby Map and will not be stored. The server is operated by FOSSGIS e.V., [whose privacy policy you can find here](https://www.fossgis.de/datenschutzerklaerung). The server keeps logs of incoming connections, but these do not allow conclusions to be drawn about the behaviour of individual users. This means that we cannot give you any information about data that your browser has sent to us. We would already fail trying to find you in the  data stream.

## How your browser contacts servers

If your browser contacts a server at the request of an application, the browser also transmits its own data in addition to the data that the application would like to have sent. In this way it tells the server its name, version and the name of the operating system including version number. Your router then adds the IP address assigned by your Internet provider. The IP address is shortened so that your full IP address is not in the logs. Servers might use also other methods of anonymizing your IP address.

## Contact us

If you contact us through the various channels such as mail, phone, email and GitHub, your information will only be used to improve the Baby Map. When using E-Mail or GitHub, third-party providers are used who handle data differently than we do. Please consult their privacy policy if you have any questions about the processing of your data on their platforms.
