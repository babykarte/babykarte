# Contribution guidelines

Thank you that you'd like to contribute to Babykarte. This set of guidelines is there to help you to understand our working process and to give an overview about the different ways of contributing.

## Mappers
Mappers can help by adding data to OpenStreetMap, the basement for all the POI data we show. Which tag we use can you read [here](usedTags.md).

## Customers 
### Issues
- If you'd like to report a bug, please give us as little information as possible about
  - what browser and OS are you using?
  - does the bug just appear on a specified POI? Link to that POI? Or it is appearing across Babykarte?
  - What are the steps to reproduce the problem?
- If you'd like to suggest a feature, please keep in mind that this map is mainly aimed at parents of babies and toddlers. New filters should contain POIs that are relevant for that age group. So e.g. no schools or youth centres.

## Developers
### Pull requests

- Before creating a pull request, please have a look at the issues. Maybe your idea has been discussed before.
- If you'd like to add features to the map (e.g. an additional filter), maybe it's a good idea to first create an issue so that we can discuss if the addition is really fitting to the project.
- Please create pull requests against the `devel` branch, not `master`.

Code contributions must follow the [code style rules](CODESTYLE.md) which is there to avoid technical problems when editing code and to make working with the codebase possible
